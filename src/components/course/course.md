**Ableton Learning Music**

Explore the fundamentals of music via Ableton's [interactive website](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/make-beats/make-beats.html).

I recommend you to go though the [Make Beats](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/make-beats/make-beats.html) chapter before making homework.

**Homework**  

1. **Open Ableton Live** and switch to **Arrangement View** (press **Tab** if needed).  
2. In the **Browser**, go to **Instruments > Drum Rack** and choose one of the following:  
   - **707 Core Kit** (for a classic, punchy sound)  
   - **808 Core Kit** (for deeper, booming bass and kicks)  
3. **Drag your chosen drum kit** onto a new **MIDI track** to load the sounds.  
4. **Try out different drum hits** using your MIDI controller or by clicking the pads in the Drum Rack.  
5. **Create a new MIDI clip**:  
   - Double-click an empty clip slot in the **MIDI track** to open the **MIDI editor**.  
6. **Draw a simple drum pattern**:  
   - Use the **pencil tool (B)** to place notes for the **kick, snare, and hi-hat**.  
   - Keep it simple‚Äîwe will refine it together in the next class!  
7. **Play back your pattern** and experiment with small changes.  
8. **If you want to try a different sound**, swap the **707 Core Kit** with the **808 Core Kit** and compare how they feel.  
9. **Save your project** so we can continue working on it next time.
