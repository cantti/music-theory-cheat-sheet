   - **707 Core Kit** (for a classic, punchy sound)  
   - **808 Core Kit** (for deeper, booming bass and kicks)  
3. **Drag your chosen drum kit** onto a new **MIDI track** to load the sounds.  
4. **Try out different drum hits** using your MIDI controller or by clicking the pads in the Drum Rack.  
5. **Create a new MIDI clip**:  
   - Double-click an empty clip slot in the **MIDI track** to open the **MIDI editor**.  
6. **Draw a simple drum pattern**:  
   - Use the **pencil tool (B)** to place notes for the **kick, snare, and hi-hat**.  
   - Keep it simple‚Äîwe will refine it together in the next class!  
7. **Play back your pattern** and experiment with small changes.  
8. **If you want to try a different sound**, swap the **707 Core Kit** with the **808 Core Kit** and compare how they feel.  
9. **Save your project** so we can continue working on it next time.  

## Lesson 3. Drums & Rhythm Pt. 2 

üóìÔ∏è ~~2 april, 16:30-18:00~~ ‚úÖ

**‚ú® Lesson Summary**

In Ableton Live, Drum Racks can be used to create both realistic drum sounds‚Äîsampled from real acoustic drum kits‚Äîand electronic sounds‚Äîsampled from vintage drum machines or synthesized from scratch.

Classic drum machines from the 1980s and 1990s have become iconic in electronic music production and are still widely used today.

**‚ú® Our song**  

In this lesson, we also continued working on our own track. We used the LinnDrum (LD Drum Rack) in Ableton and created a full song structure, including intro, verse, chorus, and outro.
